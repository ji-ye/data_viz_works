### Introduction

There are several advantages to dedicate a data visualization portfolio and 10-week effort to digital currency:

* Massive and Robust data source: Block chain is a public transaction log
  that exists as a distributed database, validated by its powerful algorithm.
    
* Fitting data types: Block chain data includes time and IP addresses, and 
  can be updated frequently, which means it is useful for both the static and
  dynamic data visualizations.
    
* Well-supported: I can save the entire block chain file locally,use 
  community-maintained tools to parse it, and keep the data up-to-date.
    
* Policy-setting: Digital currencies are being used as store of value to 
fight inflation in turbulent economies such as Zimbabwe and Latin American
countries. Central Banks are issuing experimental policies in response to 
the dissemination of digital currency and block chain technology.
    
Here I will explore some data sources published by major Bitcoin exchanges and platforms as an market overview.

### Bitcoin Price is Volatile

The price of Bitcoin can increase or decrease drastically over a
short period of time. This graph mainly serves as a preliminary 
evidence to pinpoint certain time points where a new policy or
event may have impacted the price of Bitcoin.

### Geo-spatial Plot 1:
I like this NA == White specification much more than my previous design. It really make the absence of Africa and the Middle East obvious - They're simply dissappeared from sight in the enclosed world of Bitcoin economy. And this visualization grasp that.

### What are Block Chain Nodes?
Bitcoin uses "nodes" to validate transactions and secure the network. Nodes the Bitcoin core client on a machine instance with the complete block chain. The more functioning nodes there are, the more secured the network is. This maps shows the geographic distribution of nodes. Note that not only it is uneven 
regionally, there is also an discrepancy between where the nodes are distributed (North America & Europe) and where Bitcoin could perhaps help people in economic turbulence, or lacking access to financial resources more than anywhere else (Africa).

                              sum(top_country_nodes$node))),

            ggtitle("Block Chain Network is Distributed",
                    subtitle = " in high GDP countries, with the Middle East underrepresented")
```

### National Distribution of Nodes is an Indicator for "Cryptocurrecy Friendliness"
The node-by-country ranking shown here is very well aligned with the country/region ranking of Global Financial Centres Index, which measures financial competitiveness based on "business environment", "financial sector development", "infrastructure factors", "human capital", "reputation and general factors".
These aspects are helpful in thinking about why some of high GDP countries are not hosting Bitcoin nodes. For example, Middle Eastern countries may lack the
human capital needed; while India may fall short in the financial sector development and infrastructure factors. If the correlations are not coincidental, they can be used as a reference for building a "cryptocurrency friendliness" index.

### Geo-spatial plot No. 2:
Here I have a much simpler data to visualize, and find the percentage bar fitting for presenting it. In the title writing, I experienced with the "weird comparison" discussed by Amanda Cox in her talk, in hope of leaving the viewer with something more memorable from this simple graph.

# ISSUE:graph doesn't show how USD volume precedes BTC clear enough.

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("#FF9900", "#85bb65")), 0.2) +

### Trading Volume Difference in USD and Bitcoin Shows Market Pattern

In this graph, we can see that Bitcoin's daily trading volume is extremely volatile, perhaps even more so than its price. This graph is indicative in three aspects:

1. This level of volatility can be a sign for market manipulation, especially given Bitcoin's young economy, novel nature, and lack of regulation.

2. This graph can help identify the time points where major policy changes that either encourage (spike) or discourage (trough) speculation.

3. Most interesting trend in this graph is that whenever there is a big spike, the USD volume spikes before the Bitcoin spike, which is more buyers enters the market as the price rises, potentially based on the optimistic psychology.

### The Who-trust-whom Network:
While sparse and barely visible, this graph provides some insights about the Bitcoin market. First, it allows us to identify some super raters and ratees, who are more likely to be the major player capable of manipulating Bitcoin price. Second, although orange (trustworthy) is more prevalent, there are quite a few blue spots on this heatmap, marking the users that are rated as fraud by others. At a glimpse, fraud is frequent in digital currency market, which underscores its unregulated nature.

### Low Liquidity:

This is a graph that visualizes the transaction activities of several
thousand long-term Bitcoin users during 2009 - 2013. We can see that
the majority is inactive, with one user radiating assets to many others,
and a few others repeatedly send money to themselves. Not only can this
network graph serves as a piece of evidence to show that most people 
purchase Bitcoin for the purpose of speculation, it also shows that, 
while the technological philosophy of Bitcoin is decentralization,
its ownership and commercial activity is very much the opposite.
